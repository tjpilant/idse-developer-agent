# IDSE Pipeline



Intent → Context → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Feedback


## Intent

## Context
Document environment, constraints, scale, compliance, risks.

## Specification
Structured system requirements:
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements

## Plan
Architecture, components, models, APIs, strategy.

## Tasks
Atomic units with clear testability and safe parallelization.

## Implementation
Code + tests produced from tasks.

## Feedback
Production learnings that update specs.
