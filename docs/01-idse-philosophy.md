# IDSE Philosophy

**Intent-Driven Systems Engineering (IDSE)** is a unified methodology for AI-accelerated software development.

## Core Philosophy

> Software is the expression of intent, constrained by context, structured through specification, and realized through systematic engineering.

IDSE eliminates ambiguity by transforming:



Intent → Context → Specification → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Feedback


Each phase outputs artifacts that guide the next.

## Goals

- Reduce ambiguity  
- Improve alignment between intent and implementation  
- Enable clean pivots  
- Codify reasoning, not just code  
- Create systems where specs **generate** code
